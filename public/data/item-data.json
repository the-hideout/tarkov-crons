Thanks to the powerful 7.62x25 cartridge and relatively long barrel, the TT boasts high muzzle velocity, penetration, and impressive accuracy, even over long distances.","changeLast48hPercent":-17.55,"changeLast48h":-17.55,"containsItems":[{"itemId":"571a26d524597720680fbe8a","count":1},{"itemId":"571a282c2459771fb2755a69","count":1},{"itemId":"571a29dc2459771fb2755a6a","count":1}]},"571a26d524597720680fbe8a":{"id":"571a26d524597720680fbe8a","normalized_name":"tt-762x25-116mm-barrel","base_price":1165,"width":1,"height":1,"icon_link":"https://assets.tarkov-tools.com/571a26d524597720680fbe8a-icon.jpg","image_link":"https://assets.tarkov-tools.com/571a26d524597720680fbe8a-image.jpg","grid_image_link":"https://assets.tarkov-tools.com/571a26d524597720680fbe8a-grid-image.jpg","wiki_link":"https://escapefromtarkov.fandom.com/wiki/TT_7.62x25_116mm_barrel","properties":{"accuracy":"0","recoil":"-3","ergonomics":"-4","weight":"0.06","stackMaxSize":"1","bsgCategoryId":"555ef6e44bdc2de9068b457e"},"disabled":0,"types":["mods"],"avg24hPrice":14900,"low24hPrice":14800,"high24hPrice":15000,"updated":"2022-01-21T21:35:46.000Z","traderPrices":[{"name":"Prapor","price":582},{"name":"Fence","price":466},{"name":"Skier","price":570},{"name":"Peacekeeper","price":582},{"name":"Mechanic","price":652}],"lastLowPrice":14800,"name":"TT 7.62x25 116mm barrel","shortname":"TT 116mm","description":"Standard barrel for TT pistol.","changeLast48hPercent":0,"changeLast48h":0},"571a279b24597720b4066566":{"id":"571a279b24597720b4066566","normalized_name":"tt-762x25-121mm-homespun-threaded-barrel","base_price":2149,"width":1,"height":1,"icon_link":"https://assets.tarkov-tools.com/571a279b24597720b4066566-icon.jpg","image_link":"https://assets.tarkov-tools.com/571a279b24597720b4066566-image.jpg","grid_image_link":"https://assets.tarkov-tools.com/571a279b24597720b4066566-grid-image.jpg","wiki_link":"https://escapefromtarkov.fandom.com/wiki/TT_7.62x25_121mm_homespun_threaded_barrel","properties":{"accuracy":"0","recoil":"-3.25","ergonomics":"-5","weight":"0.062","stackMaxSize":"1","bsgCategoryId":"555ef6e44bdc2de9068b457e"},"disabled":0,"types":["mods"],"avg24hPrice":8625,"low24hPrice":2000,"high24hPrice":14420,"updated":"2022-01-21T17:36:59.000Z","traderPrices":[{"name":"Prapor","price":1074},{"name":"Fence","price":859},{"name":"Skier","price":1053},{"name":"Peacekeeper","price":1074},{"name":"Mechanic","price":1203}],"lastLowPrice":2500,"name":"TT 7.62x25 121mm homespun threaded barrel","shortname":"TT 121mm thr.","description":"Homespun barrel for TT pistol, with threading for sound suppressor installation.","changeLast48hPercent":-46.79,"changeLast48h":-46.79},"571a282c2459771fb2755a69":{"id":"571a282c2459771fb2755a69","normalized_name":"tt-side-grips","base_price":1006,"width":1,"height":1,"icon_link":"https://assets.tarkov-tools.com/571a282c2459771fb2755a69-icon.jpg","image_link":"https://assets.tarkov-tools.com/571a282c2459771fb2755a69-image.jpg","grid_image_link":"https://assets.tarkov-tools.com/571a282c2459771fb2755a69-grid-image.jpg","wiki_link":"https://escapefromtarkov.fandom.com/wiki/TT_side_grips","properties":{"accuracy":"0","recoil":"0","ergonomics":"5","weight":"0.07","stackMaxSize":"1","bsgCategoryId":"55818a684bdc2ddd698b456d"},"disabled":0,"types":["mods","pistol-grip"],"avg24hPrice":8108,"low24hPrice":1569,"high24hPrice":25000,"updated":"2022-01-22T11:31:25.000Z","traderPrices":[{"name":"Prapor","price":503},{"name":"Fence","price":402},{"name":"Skier","price":492},{"name":"Peacekeeper","price":503},{"name":"Mechanic","price":563}],"lastLowPrice":5999,"name":"TT side grips","shortname":"TT grips","description":"Standard post-war issue TT pistol side grips.","changeLast48hPercent":-51.98,"changeLast48h":-51.98},"571a28e524597720b4066567":{"id":"571a28e524597720b4066567","normalized_name":"tt-762x25-makeshift-sound-suppressor","base_price":14904,"width":2,"height":1,"icon_link":"https://assets.tarkov-tools.com/571a28e524597720b4066567-icon.jpg","image_link":"https://assets.tarkov-tools.com/571a28e524597720b4066567-image.jpg","grid_image_link":"https://assets.tarkov-tools.com/571a28e524597720b4066567-grid-image.jpg","wiki_link":"https://escapefromtarkov.fandom.com/wiki/TT_7.62x25_makeshift_sound_suppressor","properties":{"accuracy":"0","recoil":"-10","ergonomics":"-12","weight":"0.332","stackMaxSize":"1","bsgCategoryId":"550aa4cd4bdc2dd8348b456c"},"disabled":0,"types":["mods","suppressor"],"avg24hPrice":9692,"low24hPrice":6988,"high24hPrice":44999,"updated":"2022-01-22T11:39:29.000Z","traderPrices":[{"name":"Prapor","price":7452},{"name":"Fence","price":5961},{"name":"Skier","price":7302},{"name":"Peacekeeper","price":7452},{"name":"Mechanic","price":8346}],"lastLowPrice":8420,"name":"TT 7.62x25 makeshift sound suppressor","shortname":"TT supp.","description":"Makeshift sound suppressor for TT with homespun barrel.

The keyhole opening provides an area to allow the four, progressively larger (from back to front) compensator cuts machined into the barrel to vent the propellant gases upwards, affording more control over the rapid-firing machine pistol.","changeLast48hPercent":-4.57,"changeLast48h":-4.57},"5b1fa9ea5acfc40018633c0a":{"id":"5b1fa9ea5acfc40018633c0a","normalized_name":"glock-18c-9x19-barrel-with-a-muzzle-brake","base_price":3184,"width":1,"height":1,"icon_link":"https://assets.tarkov-tools.com/5b1fa9ea5acfc40018633c0a-icon.jpg","image_link":"https://assets.tarkov-tools.com/5b1fa9ea5acfc40018633c0a-image.jpg","grid_image_link":"https://assets.tarkov-tools.com/5b1fa9ea5acfc40018633c0a-grid-image.jpg","wiki_link":"https://escapefromtarkov.fandom.com/wiki/Glock_18C_9x19_barrel_with_compensator","properties":{"accuracy":"0","recoil":"-6","ergonomics":"-5","weight":"0.18","stackMaxSize":"1","bsgCategoryId":"555ef6e44bdc2de9068b457e"},"disabled":0,"types":["mods"],"avg24hPrice":12467,"low24hPrice":6000,"high24hPrice":24999,"updated":"2022-01-22T09:44:56.000Z","traderPrices":[{"name":"Prapor","price":1592},{"name":"Fence","price":1273},{"name":"Skier","price":1560},{"name":"Peacekeeper","price":1592},{"name":"Mechanic","price":1783}],"lastLowPrice":8500,"name":"Glock 18C 9x19 barrel with a muzzle brake","shortname":"G18C mb","description":"A Glock 18C barrel with a mounted compensator.","changeLast48hPercent":-27.92,"changeLast48h":-27.92},"5b1faa0f5acfc40dc528aeb5":{"id":"5b1faa0f5acfc40dc528aeb5","normalized_name":"glock-18c-9x19-pistol-slide","base_price":6537,"width":2,"height":1,"icon_link":"https://assets.tarkov-tools.com/5b1faa0f5acfc40dc528aeb5-icon.jpg","image_link":"https://assets.tarkov-tools.com/5b1faa0f5acfc40dc528aeb5-image.jpg","grid_image_link":"https://assets.tarkov-tools.com/5b1faa0f5acfc40dc528aeb5-grid-image.jpg","wiki_link":"https://escapefromtarkov.fandom.com/wiki/Glock_18C_9x19_pistol_slide","properties":{"accuracy":"0","recoil":"0","ergonomics":"3","weight":"0.32","stackMaxSize":"1","bsgCategoryId":"55818a304bdc2db5418b457d"},"disabled":0,"types":["mods"],"avg24hPrice":0,"updated":"2021-12-20T01:11:24.000Z","traderPrices":[{"name":"Prapor","price":3268},{"name":"Fence","price":2614},{"name":"Skier","price":3203},{"name":"Peacekeeper","price":3268},{"name":"Mechanic","price":3660}],"lastLowPrice":50000,"name":"Glock 18C 9x19 pistol slide","shortname":"G18C","description":"Standard slide for Glock 18C 9x19 pistols.","changeLast48hPercent":0,"changeLast48h":0},"5b1fb3e15acfc4001637f068":{"id":"5b1fb3e15acfc4001637f068","normalized_name":"ak-762x39-bakelite-40-round-magazine","base_price":3586,"width":1,"height":3,"icon_link":"https://assets.tarkov-tools.com/5b1fb3e15acfc4001637f068-icon.jpg","image_link":"https://assets.tarkov-tools.com/5b1fb3e15acfc4001637f068-image.jpg","grid_image_link":"https://assets.tarkov-tools.com/5b1fb3e15acfc4001637f068-grid-image.jpg","wiki_link":"https://escapefromtarkov.fandom.com/wiki/AK_7.62x39_bakelite_40-round_magazine","properties":{"accuracy":"0","recoil":"0","ergonomics":"-7","weight":"0.32","stackMaxSize":"1","bsgCategoryId":"5448bc234bdc2d3c308b4569"},"disabled":0,"types":["mods"],"avg24hPrice":10807,"low24hPrice":3800,"high24hPrice":35000,"updated":"2022-01-22T09:51:24.000Z","traderPrices":[{"name":"Prapor","price":1793},{"name":"Fence","price":1434},{"name":"Peacekeeper","price":1793},{"name":"Mechanic","price":2008}],"lastLowPrice":3800,"name":"AK 7.62x39 bakelite 40-round magazine","shortname":"6P2 bak.","description":"A standard 40-round bakelite magazine for the RPK.

It has seen numerous military conflicts throughout the years and is still in service in certain regions of the world, in one variation or another. This one is a classic TT-33, the most mass-produced version. It features Browning short-recoil tilting-barrel system, but very different otherwise.

It's a variant of the M1911, and has been the standard-issue side arm for the Force Recon Element of the United States Marine Corps' Marine Expeditionary Units since 1985.\n\nThe improved M45A1 features several changes to the original M1911A1 design. One feature is the dual recoil spring system that spreads out the recoil force of the .45 ACP round by lowering the peak force of the recoil pulse.
